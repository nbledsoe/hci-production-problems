## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/
* Android Guidelines:
  https://developer.android.com/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* Bars (https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/bars/navigation-bars/):
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: I used this to help show me how to make a nav bar not cluttered and easy to use. The text is bold and easy to read. It was hard to use symbols instead of text so that is something that was hard to accomplish. I also made whatever tab the user was on highlighted so they could easily track what they were looking at.

* Views (https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/views/action-sheets/):
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: The forms that the user is asked to complete are simple and allow for quick and intuitive sign up. The website also never overwhelms the user and makes the feel like there is to much going on.

* Controls (https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/buttons/):
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: I made sure to use clear and short words to tell the user what the buttons at the top did and what the buttons were going to lead to.
